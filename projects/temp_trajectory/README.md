# Temperature trajectory subphenotypes

## Objective
Retrospective multi-hospital study using the CLIF framework to analyse the hospital wide differences in subphenotypes' independent relationships with hospital mortality and bloodstream infection using multivariable models. The models are published in an existing study - [Temperature Trajectory Subphenotypes in Oncology Patients with Neutropenia and Suspected Infection](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36449534/)

## Cohort definition
Patients with blood cultures within 24 hours of hospital admission between January 1, 2020 - December 31, 2022
