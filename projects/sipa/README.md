# Severity of Illness Plus Age (SIPA)

## Objective: 
Develop and validate a novel triage score using pre-life support data. 
## Cohort definition: 
All critically ill patients who required life support from March 2020 to March 2022. Life support is defined as a person receiving mechanical ventilation, being in hypoxic respiratory failure with a P/F ratio < 200, or being in shock on vasopressors. 
## Hypothesis: 
A simple triage score calculated on the bedside is at least as good as a score determined by a more complex ML model and better than SOFA.
