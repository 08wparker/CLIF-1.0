# Variation in Setting Low Tidal Volume Ventilation 

## Objective
Demonstrating CLIFâ€™s value in aligning hourly mechanical  ventilation data from several U.S. hospitals. In this study, we determine between-hospital  variation in low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), a crucial evidence-based practice for mechanically ventilated patients.


## RCLIF Tables required

* patient_demographics
* encounter_demographics_dispo
* adt 
* resp_support 
* vitals 
* labs

Follow the schema laid out in the [RCLIF ERD](https://github.com/kaveriC/CLIF-1.0/tree/main/sample_RCLIF) for each of these tables.
