# Variation in Setting Low Tidal Volume Ventilation 

## Objective
Demonstrating CLIFâ€™s value in aligning hourly mechanical  ventilation data from several U.S. hospitals. In this study, we determine between-hospital  variation in low tidal volume ventilation (LTVV), a crucial evidence-based practice for mechanically ventilated patients.
