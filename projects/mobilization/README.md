# Eligibility for mobilization

## Objective
Contrast the windows of opportunity for patient to mobilize patients on ventilators using the Patel vs TEAM criteria. 

The Patel et. al. criteria requires:
* mean arterial blood pressure of >= 65 mm Hg or <= 110 mm Hg, or
* systolic blood pressure =< 200 mm Hg
* heart rate >= 40 beats per min or <= 130 beats per min
* respiratory rate of >= 5 breaths per min or <= 40 breaths per mi
* pulse oximetry > =88%

The TEAM criteria requires:
* Heart rate ≤ 150bpm
* most recent lactate ≤ 4.0 mmol/L (ie: adequate tissue perfusion)
* noradrenaline infusion rate of ≤ 0.2mcg/kg/min, OR a
* noradrenaline infusion rate between 0.1 and 0.2mcg/kg/min (without an increase in the infusion rate of more than 25% in the last 6 hours)
* Sufficient respiratory stability to make mobilization potentially possible, as
indicated by:
    * FiO2 ≤ 0.6
    * PEEP ≤ 16cm H20
    * Current RR ≤ 45

## Cohort Definition
Patients admitted between January 1, 2022 - December 31 2023. Restrict the analysis to the first 72 hours of intubation and business hours (8am-5pm). Exclude patients who have been on ventilator for less than 2 hours and show the presence of tracheostomy in the first 72 hours.
