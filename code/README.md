## EHR -> RCLIF

Each site in the CLIF consortium has access to Electronic Health Records (EHR) from a system such as EPIC Clarity or it could be through a clinical data warehourse. 
To create an instance of RCLIF, each site has to develop scripts to transform the EHR data into the RCLIF format. This process will look different for different sites due to site-specific infrastructure and terminologies. 

This directory provides scripts to create RCLIF Respiratory support table at UCMC. We will keep updating this folder as more sites are ready to share their data. 

In addition to the sample code files in this directory, some other useful resources to aide the development of these scripts are:
1. RCLIF ERD
2. sample_RCLIF
3. CLIF limited vocabulary
